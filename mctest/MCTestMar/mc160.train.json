James has been lazy in practicing so he is not very good at baseball right now.  He has to make up for it by playing baseball for 5 hours every day for a week.  James thinks this is enough practice for him to catch up and be a good player when the season starts.  So James and Tommy practice every day.  They throw the ball around.  They practice batting and they practice fielding.  Tommy begins to see that James is getting better every day.  He says \"I do not believe it, James, but I think you are going to be pretty good when the season starts!\"  Usually a week is not enough time to get pretty good at baseball but James is practicing so much he is fitting a month of practice into one week.  Then James has a setback.  His glove rips during practice.  He can't keep playing with a broken glove!  So Tommy and James go around town collecting bottles to trade in for five cents for each bottle.  James misses a day of practicing but they find enough bottles to turn in for thirty dollars.

{"story": "I used to be afraid of butterflies!  It is true!  Once, my mom took me to Seattle.  There, we went to a special place.  We went to the zoo!  I saw lots of animals at the zoo.  I saw bears.  I saw tigers.  I saw apes.  I saw monkeys.  I saw snakes.  I loved seeing all these animals.  They made me happy.

I wasn't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying everywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They said butterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the room.  Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door! The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I was sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there!  I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.  Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.  They would try and get me to not be afraid.  Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.  She bought one for my brother, too.  I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find butterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on me and I laughed.  I liked it.

{"story": "Chocolate was a box turtle.  Lauren found her one day on the side of the road, hiding in her old, worn shell, frightened by the cars going by.  Lauren picked Chocolate up to help her cross the street, because Lauren knew that turtles are very slow and cars are very fast.  After Lauren got Chocolate to the other side of the road, Chocolate peeked her head out of her shell and looked at the little girl.  Lauren saw that not only was Chocolate's shell worn, one of her eyes was shut.  Lauren thought Chocolate needed more help from her, so Lauren took the turtle home.  Lauren hid Chocolate in her bathtub, because she was worried that her mother would be mad. Lauren went to look up what turtles like to eat and left Chocolate alone in the bathtub.  Lauren was still looking up  turtle facts when she heard her mother call out, \"Lauren, get in here now!\"  Lauren knew she was in trouble.  But when Lauren came into the bathroom, her mother was smiling.  Lauren's mom told her that she had a turtle when she was a little girl.

So, he asked a nearby squirrel. The squirrel's name was Acorn. Acorn said that he thought it was mushrooms.
