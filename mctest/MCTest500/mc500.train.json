{"story": "Scott Alan woke up very early that morning in his bedroom in his house. He felt something licking his face and he wasn't sure what it was. As he opened his green eyes slowly, he saw a bit of fur. Then he saw a tongue. After that, some more fur and then slurp!

{"story": "There was once a tiny pig who lived on a farm. He was a very cute animal, and he knew it. He liked to stay clean and soft and look as good as he could.

They were getting brown mud all over them. \"Come on,\" said his aunt. \"You can get some bread crumbs on yourself. It's okay.\" But the tiny pig only stood there and looked blue. Suddenly, a car drove up. The driver was doing too fast and splashed some mud on the tiny pig. The tiny big was sad and mad.

Finally, Bob's dad went next door and asked his neighbor, Frank, for a ladder. Frank gave the ladder to Bob's dad.

Tiger was reading a book about cooking. \"Hmm, there are so many delicious foods I have not tried yet.\" Bird arrived at Tiger's den and said \"Hello Tiger, what are you doing?\" Tiger said \"I am trying to think of what to have for dinner.\" \"How can you choose?\" asked Bird. \"Why don't we pick a color and eat something that is that color\" said Tiger. \"How about red?\" said Bird. \"Yes! Like a fox!\" said Tiger. \"I know where a fox is!\" said Bird, \"I'll show you.\" So Tiger followed Bird all the way across the forest. Finally they arrived outside Fox's home. \"Pretend you are asleep and wait right here\", said Bird to Tiger. Bird then flew in to Fox's home very happy. \"Fox, I have found a big yummy treat for you and you won't ever be hungry again! Follow me outside.\" Fox followed Bird outside and said \"WOW! A whole tiger! Yum!\" Then Tiger jumped up and gobbled up Fox in one bite. Fox was now inside Tiger's belly and he yelled out \"Bird, you lied to me! Why?!\" \"Because you ate my sister!\" yelled Bird. \"That wasn't me, it was Snake!\" cried Fox. \"Oh. Um, sorry Fox. Well at least you don't have to hunt for food now\" said Bird.

Jerry also had other animals on his farm, such as pigs, dogs, cats, and cows. One day Jerry wanted to paint his barn. He could not find his ladder. He looked in the barn, in his house, in his garage, and in his field. Since he could not find it he had to stand on a table. It took Jerry six days to paint his barn that way. Jerry's favorite activity was to sit on his porch and sip lemonade. He would watch the clouds float by in the sky. He thought they looked a lot like his sheep. Every night when Jerry went to sleep, he would listen to the sound of the wind blowing across the fields on his farm.

{"story": "There was once a pig named Oink, who lived on a farm, but spent most of his days in a factory making shoes. In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly. He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star.

{"story": "Once upon a time there was a boy monster named Jerry who lived in a train car at the railroad tracks. He had lived there all his life. Jerry's mother was named Marge, and she was 36. Marge raised Jerry at the railroad tracks because she wanted to keep him safe. She was afraid of the people who lived in the town nearby. The town was named Qarth, and 100 people lived there. Marge believed that the people of Qarth would attack them if they knew they were there. Qarth used to be filled with factories when Jerry was born. By the time Jerry was a teenager, most of the factories had gone away and most of the people worked on special new machines. They ate food from the fields outside of town.

He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog. His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn, carrots, and drink all of his milk too. That night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too. Michael, wondered if his best friends Joe, Nick, and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep. The next day he hopped from one foot to the other as his class lined up to get on the bus that would take him to the zoo. On the bus he sat with Ryan. The bus driver started the engine and turned the big steering wheel leading them out on to the road. Finally, at the zoo Michael began to imagine how cool it would be to finally get to see the lion cage. First his class went to see the monkeys and then headed over to see the long necked giraffes. As their teacher announced that they would then be going to see the elephants, we wondered if he would ever get to see the lions. Finally after learning about the elephants it was time to see the lions. The lion stood on a huge rock and swung its long tail from side to side. The lion licked his lips with its long pink tongue and Michael wondered if it was thinking about having a class full of kids for its lunch.", "story_id": "mc500.train.158", "question_id": "4", "question": "What was Michael's favorite food?", "q_type": "one", "choices": ["carrots", "milk", "Corn", "Hotdogs"], "answer": "D", "text_answer": "Hotdogs", "label": "3"}

She was never very good at Math. Her brother always teased her because he was great at Math, History, and Science, but she preferred Art. To raise her grades, Jill spent the week before finals studying every day in the school library.

My aunt once told me a whole story about it, in which it was passed down through the family for many, many years, only to come to me. I was pretty little at the time, so I believed her with no question. It made me think that the bank was important. It became some sort of sign of family and togetherness. I would imagine my mom and my grandmother and even my great grandmother before that, putting coins in the little white pig and waiting for them to fill it up, to be spent on some sort of treasure. And then, when I was fifteen, I broke it. I didn't mean to. I was cleaning my room in a hurry, so I could finish quickly and go to a friend's house. I swung the vacuum hose around too quickly, knocking the pig's shelf, and down it went. About a thousand pieces, and way fewer coins than I would have believed, flew everywhere. I started to cry. My mother came in at the sound of the crash. \"I'm so, so sorry!\" I cried. \"I broke the bank! I broke the family bank!\" \"What, Sarah?\" my mother asked, kneeling next to me on the floor. \"The what?\" \"The bank! Aunt Tracy said it was in the family for years!\" \"What, this? We got it for you at a garage sale when you were two.

What Billy didn't know was, Juno had been sleeping since he left and she was ready for another game of catch me if you can, her favorite game. Juno took off running as soon as she saw Billy. Billy sat down on the grass to wait. Billy found a ball and started to throw it for Juno to fetch. Billy kept on throwing the ball and Juno kept on bringing it back until Juno dropped the ball and lay down on the grass, panting, tired out. Billy quickly slipped the collar and leash on her. Billy got Juno on her feet and the two of them walked round to the back yard where the family were sitting outside enjoying the sunshine. Billy's father called him to come and enjoy some ice cream with them but Billy said no, he'd rather get Juno's bath time over with and then he could enjoy his ice cream. Billy knew he had to hurry or his brothers Allen and Greg would finish the Rocky Road ice cream which was Billy's favorite. Billy tied Juno's leash to the fence and then he brought the hose over and switched it on. Juno immediately tried to run away but she had no choice but to stay there and let Billy soak her. Billy quickly added soap to Juno's coat and soon she was covered in soapy suds. Soon Billy once again turned the hose on Juno to rinse all the soap out of her coat. The last thing to be done was to rub Juno down with a towel and dry her off Once Billy had finished he took the collar and leash off and Juno lay down in the sun happy that bath time was over once again. Billy went to join the rest of the family and his father said he could choose between Chocolate Chip, Caramel Delight, Cookies and Cream or Rocky Road ice cream. Billy quickly said he wanted the Rocky Road and his father put down a large dish of the ice cream and said 'good job son'", "story_id": "mc500.train.202", "question_id": "4", "question": "What is the dog's name?", "q_type": "multiple", "choices": ["Juno", "George", "Greg", "Sasha"], "answer": "A", "text_answer": "Juno", "label": "0"}

{"story": "Once upon a time, there was a little white mouse that lived on a farm. He liked to hide in the hay stacks where it was warm through the day and night. On cold winter days, he would wiggle out from the hay stack to get closer to the lamp in the barn, getting some extra warmth. One winter day, the mouse was very cold, but needed something to eat. He left the hay stack, and ran past the lamp. He ran across an old wood board that was laying on top of the snow - the mouse didn't have mittens and wanted to keep his feet warm. He ran and ran until he couldn't any longer. The cold weather was keeping every living thing inside, so the mouse was all alone. He walked towards the house and met a little bug named Fred. Fred told the mouse that he went inside and found lots of crumbs to eat on the kitchen floor. The mouse waited until the farmer's wife, Julie, came out the back door, and then the mouse ran into the kitchen. There were bread crumbs everywhere!

{"story": "One hot summer day in August my family and I wanted to go to the beach. We had not gone to the beach in a very long time and felt that today was a great day to do it.

It felt really good to cool off in the ocean water on such a hot day. As I swam around I saw many cool things, like fish, seaweed, and shells. I brought the interesting shells that I found to a bucket I had on the beach and threw them in. They would be great to add to my collection at home.
