While walking, Brian passed his favorite toy store, and saw that they had a new baseball glove in the window.  Brian's baseball glove was very old and was ripped in a few places.  Brian really wanted the new glove because he wanted to show off his glove to his friends tomorrow. The cost of the new glove was fifteen dollars, but when Brian checked his pockets for money, he only had six dollars and fifty cents.  Brian ran home and went to look around his house for money. He checked under his bed and found fifty cents under some toys.  He then checked all of his pockets of his pants and shorts, and found another two dollars.  Brian then went to look between the cushions on all of the couches in his house, and he found another three dollars.  After finally looking around his whole house, Brian knew that he still did not have enough money to buy the new glove.  Brian went outside and saw his dad doing yard work. He told his dad that he would finish all the yard work for him, if he could have the money he needed for the new glove.  His dad said yes, so Brian spent the rest of the afternoon raking the yard, and bagging leaves.  Brian's dad was very proud that his son was working hard for money. When Brian was finally done, Brian knew that he was too late, and the toy store was closed.  Just as Brian was walking inside, he saw his dad walk up to home holding the new glove that he wanted.

mc160.dev.22	Author: 3310356749;Work Time(s): 2220	It was a beautiful sunny and warm day. I was working outside in my garden. I was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake. On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. I got up from my garden and walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" to other lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. Then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it coming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt very special that I got to see this. It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.	one: What was I doing on this day at the beginning of the story?	fishing	sleeping	working in the garden	cooking	one: What did I finally see?	two lake birds	four lake birds	three lake birds	one lake bird	multiple: What was the sound that I kept hearing?	something that sounded like laughing	something that sounded like low talking	something that sounded like crying	something that sounded like singing	multiple: How did I feel at the end of the story?	happy	sick	sad	glum

George's wife was also in the pond.  Her name was Nancy. Magneson walked over to the tree.  Nancy flew up into the tree.  She wanted to warn Magneson about the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree.  A few years before, the squirrel had thrown a chestnut at George and Nancy's son.  He was knocked out, and the squirrel took him away.  He was never seen again. Magneson asked what their son's name was.  They said it was Leonard.  But Magneson was only making small talk.  He didn't believe the story about the killer squirrel.  Even if there was one, there were many rocks by the pond that he could throw at the squirrel.  He could also hide in the tall grass. George and Nancy were sorry to see that Magneson wouldn't listen.  They flew away, singing a sad song.  A short time later, the squirrel came out of the tree and threw a giant walnut at Magneson.

mc160.dev.25	Author: 868073141;Work Time(s): 5062	Once there was a young boy named Bret who had a cat named Wolfgang.  The boy had really wanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked to blow things down and they snored.  So the boy had to call his cat Wolfie. He had also thought about naming his cat Sir Purrsalot.  Bret himself planned to become a knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought Sir Purrsalot sounded like a good name for his brother knight.  The difficulty there was that Wolfie didn't purr a lot.  He purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.  Plus Bret's mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the bathroom and they clanked. So Bret was left with a cat named Wolfgang.  The neighbors gave him strange looks when he stood in the front yard in the evening and yelled "Wolfie!  Here Wolfie!!!", to get Wolfgang to come in for the night.  But Bret didn't care what anyone else thought.  He had a Wolfie and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.	multiple: When did Wolfie purr?	when hogging the bathroom	when petted	when poked	when sleeping	multiple: What was the name of the cat?

Day after day, Puddles would have to eat cat food and do cat things in order to fit in with the rest of his group. He found it very boring and Puddles was sad. Puddles didn't even look like a cat! All of the other cats teased Puddles. "You're too big," they said. "You've got too long of a nose!" "Why are you panting like that?" Puddles knew that he was different. One day, Puddles chose to run away from all of the cats. The cats laughed at him. What a stupid dog! Didn't he know that there were monsters in the woods that could eat him? Puddles didn't care, because Puddles was sad enough to try. So Puddles packed up his things - his squeaky ball, his water dish, and his bone - and headed off into the woods. He was finally happy! All of a sudden, Puddles turned. He smelled a funny smell. It smelled like something he had never smelled before. He turned around, and what did he see but another dog!
