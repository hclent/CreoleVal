One day a young mouse was out taking a walk to collect some berries. It was a nice day out, so the mouse chose to go down by the river to take a quick rest for a bit. When the mouse arrived at the river he found the perfect spot to rest. It was a small little area with soft sand to lie on, under a tree that gave a bit of shade. The mouse then sat back. After a little bit of time the mouse was fast asleep. Not long after the mouse had fallen asleep, the cat caught a scent in the air of the young mouse. The cat walked slowly up to the spot where the mouse was sleeping and licked his lips. Right when the cat was about to catch the mouse, the mouse woke up. \"What are you doing?!\" asked the mouse in surprise. \"I am trying to find dinner,\" said the cat. The mouse smiled. \"I collected extra berries today on my walk. Would you like to have some?\" The cat was confused. He had never been given such a kind thing. \"Well, OK.

Maybe that's why I feel so hungry.\" But, now, she wondered if there was anything she could do so she wouldn't feel so hungry, even if she did stop eating meat. She went to the library, and there, she saw a magazine. Below the title, the cover said, \"Learn to live on vegetables!\" She read in the magazine that it was good to change her meal plan slowly. If she really felt hungry for a little meat, the magazine said, it was okay to have some, and then go back to eating her veggies.

When they made it outside, they saw an animal the size of a bear digging in their yard before it went deep. Before they even knew it, they heard their mama screaming from inside the house. They both looked in the window to see the bunny cornering the mama, but it had grown ten times bigger and looked angry.

{"story": "In a big forest lived a fox named Manny. He was having a fun morning. Dad had given him a cookie as a snack and it was yummy! Now he was wandering through the woods, looking for an adventure. After a little bit he came across a frog sitting on a log. They looked at each other, but did not say anything. Manny spoke first. \"Hi there, my name is Manny and I'm a fox. Who are you?\" The frog on the log didn't answer at first. He finally said, \"My name is Tony and I'm a frog. My brother could beat you up.\" Manny was very surprised to hear this. First, why would a frog's brother want to fight him? Second, how could some little frog beat him up? Manny told Tony he didn't think he would want to fight his brother because he would hurt him. Tony jumped off the log and hopped away, shouting over his shoulder, \"You're a liar! My brother can beat up anyone!\" As the frog went away, Manny was very confused. He didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but the frog was sad because of what Manny said. Manny also did not like to be called a liar, so he ran after the frog. He soon found out that Tony's brother was not from the same mother. His brother was a brown bear named Greg. After taking a good look at Greg, Manny said yes, Greg could beat up anyone he chose.
